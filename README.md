My Daily Goal
=============

My Daily Goal is an app that helps your reach your goals.
It was initially inspired by
[Jerry Seinfeld's productivity tip](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)
and helped me break my snooze button addiction.

Made with Ruby on Rails and Mr. T.

It's a nifty little Rails app that sends users an email a day for each one of their goals. Something like this:

> *From:* hello@mydailygoal.net
> *Subject:* Wake up early: 12-day streak, new record!

> Heyooo! Did you meet your daily goal? If you did, click here:

> [http://www.mydailygoal.net/goals/d313a8ed-wake-up-early/awyea](#)

> If you missed your goal, no worries: we'll try again tomorrow.

> Keep being awesome.

> \-\-

> Edit your settings here: http://www.mydailygoal.net/goals/d313a8ed-wake-up-early/edit

The cool part is that it's completely authentication-less:
users can create a goal in one click. No signup, no password, no problem.
